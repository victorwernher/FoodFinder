##Food Finder

This application is designed to make it easier to decide where to get food.

The idea was to keep it very simple. It takes your current, or last known location
and bring up restaurants near you. Swipe left and right to scroll through them
and up to like and navigate to the selected restaurant and down to dislike it
and remove it from the possible selections in the future.

Troubleshooting: There might be a problem on the initial login after it asks for permissions.
If that happens and all that is shown to you is a white screen, then please log out and log back in.
