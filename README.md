##Food Finder

This application is designed to make it easier to decide where to get food.



The idea was to keep it very simple. It takes your current, or last known location
and bring up restaurants near you. Swipe left and right to scroll through them
and up to like and navigate to the selected restaurant and down to dislike it
and remove it from the possible selections in the future.



For deliverables we are able to do everything stated above. Save likes and dislikes
into the Firebase database according to user. Login is handled with a modified
Firebase UI. We are able to pull your current or last know location. If you Swipe
up it will begin navigation. Swipe down adds a dislike and prevents that item
from showing up in the future. We also have a user info page that allows you to
view your likes and dislikes and remove them as desired.

Logging in: If you want to use our test accounts, username: csci567foodfinder@gmail.com 
and password:#!FF22536 work for both logins. 

Troubleshooting: There might be a problem on the initial login after it asks for permissions.
If that happens and all that is shown to you is a white screen, then please log out and log back in.
